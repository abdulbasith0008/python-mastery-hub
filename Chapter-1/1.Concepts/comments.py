'''### COMMENTS IN PYTHON
Comments are used to write explanatory notes in the code that are not executed. These help improve code readability.

#### TYPES OF COMMENTS

   To write a single-line comment, add `#` at the beginning of the line.
   
   ```python'''

#Examples for types of comments:

#single line comment: Use ctrl+/ to use hash symbol .
# (In programming, the hash symbol (#) is typically used to denote a 
# "preprocessor directive," meaning it signifies a command that the compiler 
# needs to execute before compiling the actual code)
