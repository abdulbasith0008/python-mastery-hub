'''Let's write our very first Python program. Create a file called `hello.py` and paste the following code into it:

```python
print("Hello, World!")  # print is a function (more on this later)
```

Execute this file (`.py` file) by typing the following command in the terminal:

```sh
python hello.py
```

You will see `Hello, World!` printed on the screen.'''

print("Hello , This is Shaik !") 
#print function is used to display the output to the user.

#Additional Reference

'''First Python Program
Problem: Create a Python program that prints your name and age.

ðŸ”¹ Hint: Modify the print function to display your name and age.'''

print("I'm Shaik , 25 years old!")
