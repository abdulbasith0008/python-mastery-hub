'''A string is a data type in Python that represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
 Strings can be defined using:
 ### **STRING SLICING**
String slicing allows us to extract a part of a string using index positions. The index starts from `0` to `length - 1` in Python.

#### **Basic Slicing Syntax:**
```python
word = "amazing"
print(word[1:6])  # Output: "mazin"
```
'''

a="shaik"
a='shaik'
a='''shaik'''

#string slicing

a="shaikispro" #shaik(0,1,2,3,4)
print(a[0:5]) #This will prints shaik starting from index 0 to 4

#To get the single character from string
print(a[3]) #just give the index number of the character
